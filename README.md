# Real-Time Anomaly Detection of Injection Attacks using Machine Learning Models in Cybersecurity

## Overview
This project presents a real-time anomaly detection system for identifying **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks using machine learning models. It features a Flask-based API, live dashboard visualization, and system resource monitoring. The project also integrates foundational elements of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **chatbots** to assist in real-time responses and contextual analysis.

## Objectives
- Detect injection-based attacks (SQLi, XSS) in real time.
- Display anomalies and threat metrics through an interactive dashboard.
- Use LLMs to enhance natural language understanding and chatbot capabilities.
- Enable future expansion for adaptive, explainable AI-driven cybersecurity.

## Features
-  Real-time classification of web queries using Random Forest and Decision Tree models.
-  Dynamic dashboard to track system metrics and detection logs.
-  Alert system with risk levels and detailed threat logging.
-  Integrated chatbot powered by LLM prompts for describing threats to users.
-  Logs user input, threat level, model confidence, and timestamps.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **ML Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, TF-IDF
- **Backend:** Flask, Socket.IO
- **Frontend:** Chart.js, HTML/CSS
- **LLMs & Tools:** Prompt-based querying of GPT for contextual threat explanations

## Use of LLMs and Chatbots
- Developed a basic chatbot interface that interprets threat classifications using prompts to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) for human-readable explanations.
- Used LLMs to explain the nature of detected injection patterns (e.g., explaining an SQL payload in simple language).
- Enables future integration of **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, or **RAG-based architectures** for deeper conversational capabilities.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-anomaly-detection.git
cd real-time-anomaly-detection
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python flask_api/app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## System Performance
| Metric             | Value     |
|--------------------|-----------|
| SQLi Accuracy       | 98.4%     |
| XSS Accuracy        | 97.6%     |
| Response Time       | ~450 ms   |
| CPU Usage           | ~35%      |
| Memory Usage        | ~60%      |

## Sample Query (via Postman or CURL)
```json
POST http://localhost:5000/predict
{
  "queryText": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id='1' OR '1'='1';"
}
```

## Future Research
- Integrate explainable AI (XAI) with LLMs to justify model decisions.
- Extend dataset with real-world threat data from honeypots.
- Enhance chatbot with memory and user-adaptive dialogue via LangChain or RAG pipelines.
- Real-time streaming data ingestion (Kafka/Flume).
- Deploy via Docker/Kubernetes for large-scale inference.
